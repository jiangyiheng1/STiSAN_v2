Paper: Spatial-Temporal Interval Aware Individual Future Trajectory Prediction (IEEE TKDE)

This code includes the core components in STiSAN+, 

1. Rotary Time Aware Position Encoder (RoTAPE), 
2. multi-head Interval Aware Attention Block (IAAB) and 
3. Spatial-Temporal Relation Memory (STR Memory),

which can be extended to attention based sequential models.
